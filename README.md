# database
Repository that includes all the codes to set-up a 21cmFAST database

TODO list:
    -    check cosmology
    -    check whether to calculate all velocity components. Will set to False
         now, since it doesn't seem like kSZ likelihood will be used.
    -    check whether R'_'BUBBLE'_'MAX parameter should be used since it's not
         present in master.
    -    add default astro parameters
    -    Ask YQ whether Prior() should be used. If yes, might be easier to put
         it into 21CMMC.
    -    Add HERA likelihood!
    -    discuss some mcmc options.
    -    add my zeus and my 21cmfast and my 21cmmc to environment file
